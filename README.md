# dotfiles
I save my run config preferences here. mostly for git alias
Inspriation for this directory is to save custom rc and have it be portable

## Setup
clone the repo and run .bash install.sh to source these files to your rc files.
if any of the files are missing you will get an alert whenever you are accessing any rc file.
