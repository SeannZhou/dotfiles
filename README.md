# dotfiles
I save my run config preferences here. mostly for git alias
Inspriation for this directory is to save custom rc and have it be portable

## Setup
this repo should be cloned in your $HOME directory, the install.sh file is harded coded to check for 
$HOME/{this repo dot files} for all the custom rc scripts.
clone the repo and run .bash install.sh to source these files to your rc files.
this install script is safe to run multiple times
